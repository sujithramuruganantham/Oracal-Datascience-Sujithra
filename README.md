# Enhancing Road Safety with AI-driven Traffic Accident Analysis and Prediction

This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict traffic accidents. The goal is to enhance road safety by identifying accident-prone areas, predicting accidents, and providing actionable insights for policymakers, traffic authorities, and urban planners.

## About

Traffic accidents are a significant cause of injuries and fatalities worldwide. By analyzing historical traffic data, weather conditions, and other factors, AI models can identify patterns and predict high-risk zones and times, leading to better preventive measures and resource allocation.

This project aims to:
- **Analyze** traffic accident data to uncover patterns and contributing factors.
- **Predict** accident-prone areas and times using machine learning models.
- **Visualize** accident data and predictions through interactive maps and charts.
- **Provide actionable insights** for improving traffic management and road safety.

## Features

- **Accident Analysis**: Process historical accident data to analyze trends, locations, and risk factors.
- **Prediction Model**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict high-risk accident areas based on current conditions.
- **Data Visualization**: Display accident hotspots and prediction results on an interactive map or chart.
- **Real-time Integration**: Optionally integrate real-time traffic and weather data to make predictions.
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate and categorize risk levels for different traffic zones and times.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-traffic-safety.git
    cd ai-traffic-safety
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the datasets**:
   - Download traffic accident datasets from public data sources like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or government portals.
   - Store the datasets in the `data/` directory.

5. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6. **Access the web interface** (if applicable):
    Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the app.

## Usage

### Analyzing Traffic Accidents

- Load the accident data (e.g., location, time, weather).
- Preprocess the data (cleaning, normalization, feature extraction).
- Train a machine learning model using algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.

### Predicting Accidents

- Input real-time traffic and weather data to predict accident risks in specific areas.
- View results in an interactive map or table, showing accident predictions and risk zones.

### Example Code Snippet

```python
from model import AccidentPredictor

# Load pre-trained model
predictor = AccidentPredictor(model_path='models/accident_predictor.pkl')

# Sample input: Traffic conditions, time of day, weather
sample_input = {
    'traffic_density': 80,
    'weather': 'rainy',
    'time_of_day': 'night',
    'location': 'Intersection A'
}

# Predict accident risk
predicted_risk = predictor.predict(sample_input)
print(f"Predicted accident risk: {predicted_risk}")
